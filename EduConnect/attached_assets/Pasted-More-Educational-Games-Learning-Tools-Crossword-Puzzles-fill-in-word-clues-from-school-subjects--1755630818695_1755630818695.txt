Math Duel (Multiplayer) → two learners solve math problems in real-time (via Socket.IO).

Virtual Science Lab → mix elements (simulated chemistry).

Geography Map Explorer → drag country → correct position on Africa/world map.

📊 Dashboards & Tracking

Learner Progress Dashboard: XP points, badges, game stats, practice quiz scores, streaks.

Teacher Dashboard Additions: heatmaps of weak areas in class (Math/English/etc.), assignment completion rate.

Parent Portal (optional): SMS/email notifications when child reaches milestones or reports issues.

🤝 Social & Group Features

Study Groups (already planned): add voice rooms (WebRTC) for group discussions.

Leaderboards per grade, per school, national (gamified).

Safe Chat Filters → real-time AI/moderation to block bad words.

“Buddy System”: learners pair up and solve tasks together.

🧠 Accessibility & AI Assistants
