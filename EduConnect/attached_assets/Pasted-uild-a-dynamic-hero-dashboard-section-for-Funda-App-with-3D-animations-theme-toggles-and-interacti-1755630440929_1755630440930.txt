uild a dynamic hero/dashboard section for Funda-App with 3D animations, theme toggles, and interactive UI. Use Next.js (frontend) + TailwindCSS + React Three Fiber / Three.js for 3D. Backend (Express + MongoDB) already exists — you’re only focusing on the frontend UI enhancements.

Features to Implement
1. 3D Floating Dashboard Icons

Icons: Practice Zone, Games Zone, Study Group, Classroom, AI Assistants, Support Center.

Animation:

Icons float up & down in 3D space with slow rotation.

On hover: icon pops forward, rotates faster, shows stronger shadow.

Implementation: Use react-three-fiber (Three.js for React). Place each icon as a 3D mesh or GLTF model.

2. Dynamic Theme Toggle (4 Themes)

Toggle placement: Navigation bar or user settings.

Themes:

Default (light) → white / gray backgrounds

Dark → black / dark gray backgrounds

Vibrant → bold, saturated accents (blue, green, orange)

Soft → pastel blues/greens/browns

Behavior:

Smooth animated transition when switching themes.

Save selected theme in localStorage so it persists.

Implementation: TailwindCSS theme variants with class toggle (e.g., data-theme="dark").

3. 3D Animated Logo Intro

Logo: Cartoon-style mascot for Funda-App (simple shape, placeholder OK).

Intro animation:

On first load, logo runs/jumps/flies into the screen.

After animation, logo settles at top of hero section.

Implementation: react-three-fiber with GSAP or Drei’s animation helpers.

Performance: Should be lightweight, non-blocking, <2s.

Example Code (Floating 3D Icon in Three.js)
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber'
import { useFrame } from '@react-three/fiber'
import { Mesh } from 'three'
import { useRef } from 'react'

function FloatingIcon() {
  const ref = useRef<Mesh>(null!)
  useFrame(() => {
    ref.current.position.y = Math.sin(Date.now() * 0.001) * 0.2
    ref.current.rotation.y += 0.01
  })
  return (
    <mesh ref={ref}>
      <boxGeometry args={[1,1,1]} />
      <meshStandardMaterial color="orange" />
    </mesh>
  )
}

export default function Hero() {
  return (
    <Canvas>
      <ambientLight intensity={0.5} />
      <directionalLight position={[2,2,2]} />
      <FloatingIcon />
    </Canvas>
  )
}
